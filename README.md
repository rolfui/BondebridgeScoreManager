# BondebridgeScoreManager
A HTML/Javascript program for managing "bondebride" scores.

## Installing

1. Download the file 'bondebridge.html' (You might also be able to open it directly in your browser.)
2. Open the file in your browser (Program is tested with MS Edge and Firefox, but compability issues might occur.)
3. The program uses no network interaction after download. The HTML file can be used in your browser when offline as well.

## Usage

1. Add as many players as wanted by pressing the button "+ Add player +"
2. The leftmost column with text boxes is the players names. Type the players name here.
3. Play the game:
	1. Write what each player bids for that round in the bid row.
	2. Write what each player got for that round in the got row.
	3. The program will update the score row, and manages the scores.

### Some tips

* Type "enter" when writing in the "bid" or "got" row and the program will move the caret to the next appropriate text box to write in.
